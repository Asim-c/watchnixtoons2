# WatchNixtoons2

Respectfully forked from doko-desuka, I've modified the plugin to allow the use of premium member user login to bypass the occassional free usage block due to high volume.  

You can provide your username and password from this addon's setting menu on the interface screen.  This plugin modification will not work unless you are premimum user on their site.  As of the time of this readme creation, the monthly cost is $2.99 which is very fair for the amount of available anime and cartoons this site has to offer.  Consider becoming a member and help this site to continue.
